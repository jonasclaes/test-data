# Test Data Repository

A collection of sample files for automated testing, quality assurance, and development workflows.

## üéØ Purpose

This repository provides a variety of test files including documents, images, media files, and data formats that can be used for:

- **Automated testing scripts** - File processing and validation tests
- **Quality assurance workflows** - Consistent test scenarios across environments  
- **CI/CD pipelines** - Reliable test data for continuous integration

## üöÄ Use

To use files from this repository in your tests or applications, use the GitHub raw content endpoint:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonasclaes/test-data/main/path/to/your/file.ext
```

For version-specific access, use a commit hash instead of the branch name:

```
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonasclaes/test-data/{commit-hash}/path/to/your/file.ext
```

**Example:**
```bash
# Download a test file directly (latest version)
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonasclaes/test-data/main/pdfs/basic.pdf

# Download from a specific commit
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jonasclaes/test-data/abc123def456/pdfs/basic.pdf
```

**Benefits of using permalinks:**
- **Reliable URLs** - Files are accessible from any environment
- **Version control** - Use specific commits for consistent test data
- **Immutable references** - Commit hashes ensure the exact same file content
- **No local storage** - Fetch files on-demand in CI/CD pipelines
- **Easy integration** - Works with any HTTP client or testing framework
